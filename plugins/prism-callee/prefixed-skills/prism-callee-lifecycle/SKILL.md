  Run the Prism lifecycle through the Callee Router and its Story or Epic
  graphs. Beads stores durable state. Use when the user runs
  $prism-callee:lifecycle, /prism-callee:lifecycle, /prism-callee-lifecycle,
  or asks to run Prism through Callee subagents.

# Prism Callee lifecycle

This is the only Prism surface that may execute callee agent run prism/... .

## Reference contracts

- [PromptKit authoring contract](references/promptkit.md): Read only when
  inspecting, regenerating, or changing the checked-in Callee pack. Do not load
  it for normal lifecycle execution.
- [Breakdown normalization contract](references/breakdown.md): Read when a
  Story reaches Breakdown or when reconciling its task graph.

The host owns Beads resolution, durable labels, approval authority, Epic batch
coordination, and persistence after every Callee return. The Callee Router owns
only deterministic selection between the declared Story and Epic graphs.

## Imported Callee runtime surface

| Agent ID | Role |
| --- | --- |
| prism/lifecycle | Router selecting exactly one Story or Epic graph |
| prism/story | Direct six-phase Story graph |
| prism/epic | Direct six-phase Epic graph |
| prism/phases/* | Story phase resources used by prism/story |
| prism/epic/phases/* | Epic phase resources used by prism/epic |

For normal installed execution, resolve the three public roots through Callee's
default agent catalog:

    callee agent list | grep '^prism/'
    callee agent view prism/lifecycle --json
    callee agent view prism/story --json
    callee agent view prism/epic --json

Require all three imported roots. Require the lifecycle view to report kind
`Router` with declared `story` and `epic` branches. A missing root or a
Story-only `Sequential` lifecycle is a stale catalog. Stop before execution and
tell the operator to refresh it:

    callee agent import baldaworks/prism-callee --path pack/callee/prism --prefix prism --force

After refresh, repeat the default-catalog list and view checks. Do not bypass a
stale catalog by invoking a direct graph or adding a repository-local agent
root to normal runtime.

Use `--agent-root pack/callee` only while maintaining this repository and only
after confirming `pack/callee/prism` exists. Marketplace runtime must not depend
on the Prism source checkout.

## Durable lifecycle state

Story phases:

| Phase | Beads label | Callee graph phase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specify | phase:story:specify | prism/phases/specify |
| Design | phase:story:design | prism/phases/design |
| Breakdown | phase:story:breakdown | prism/phases/breakdown |
| Human | phase:story:human | prism/phases/human |
| Apply | phase:story:apply | prism/phases/apply |
| Verify | phase:story:verify | prism/phases/verify |

Epic phases:

| Phase | Beads label | Callee graph phase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frame | phase:epic:frame | prism/epic/phases/frame |
| Architecture | phase:epic:architecture | prism/epic/phases/architecture |
| Roadmap | phase:epic:roadmap | prism/epic/phases/roadmap |
| Approval | phase:epic:approval | prism/epic/phases/approval |
| Delivery | phase:epic:delivery | prism/epic/phases/delivery |
| Validation | phase:epic:validation | prism/epic/phases/validation |

prism is the membership label. human:approved authorizes only the current
item: Story implementation for a Story, or Epic architecture and roadmap for
an Epic. It never authorizes a child Story and never transfers between items.

Ignore phase-like labels outside the supported Story and Epic namespaces as
absent and never migrate them. Multiple supported phases fail closed. A Story
with an Epic phase, an Epic with a Story phase, or any other type-incompatible
supported phase fails closed without mutating children. A missing supported
phase initializes a Story at phase:story:specify or an Epic at
phase:epic:frame and clears stale approval.

The only valid hierarchy is Epic → Story → Task. Direct Epic Tasks and nested
Epics fail closed. Story Tasks retain prism/apply/implementer and
prism/apply/reviewer ownership inside the Story Apply loop.

## Prerequisites

1. Beads and a project workspace: bd where and bd prime.
2. Callee 0.19.0 or a compatible Router-capable release on PATH, with provider
   authentication for Role phases.
3. Discoverable imported Prism resources: `callee agent list` includes
   `prism/lifecycle`, `prism/story`, and `prism/epic`.

Do not use provider output to select a route. Do not invoke a direct Callee
graph when host Beads resolution is required; route the current item through
prism/lifecycle.

## Target resolver

Resolve exactly one operation using this priority order:

1. Explicit all-open-Epic batch intent. This is the only operation that
   traverses more than one item.
2. Explicit Story or Epic ID. Require the matching Beads issue type.
3. Explicit Task ID. Resolve exactly one Story parent; missing or ambiguous
   parentage fails closed.
4. Resume with no ID only when exactly one open Prism Story or Epic is
   unambiguous. Multiple candidates fail closed.
5. Clear multi-Story initiative intent. Create or resume an Epic.
6. Ordinary change intent. Create or resume a Story.

For a new Story use prism,phase:story:specify. For a new Epic use
prism,phase:epic:frame. Replace labels rather than inheriting a parent phase.
Never use an assignee as phase state.

## Route envelope

Accept the operator's invocation as ordinary free-form text. Resolve the target
and Beads state from that request, then construct the envelope internally. Do
not ask the operator to provide `ROUTE`, `ITEM_ID`, `ITEM_TYPE`, or
`BEADS_CONTEXT`, and do not present the runner command as the normal user UX.

The host constructs one complete envelope before invoking the Router:

    ROUTE=story
    ITEM_ID=prism-...
    ITEM_TYPE=story
    ORIGINAL_REQUEST:
    <complete operator request>
    BEADS_CONTEXT:
    <current item, labels, phase, approval, children, and dependencies>

For an Epic, the first line is ROUTE=epic and ITEM_TYPE is epic. The first line
must be exactly ROUTE=story or ROUTE=epic followed by a newline (or end of input
when there is no further context). The Router's
anchored route template rejects unknown, blank, or malformed first lines; it
has no default child and never retries a different branch. The Router body
forwards the complete original prompt to the selected graph. The host never
lets a provider select an undeclared route.

Invoke the public root only after constructing the envelope:

    callee agent run prism/lifecycle --message "$envelope"

Persist the Callee artifact and Beads transition before selecting the next
phase. A selected child failure remains attached to the current item.

## Advance loop

For a Story, continue successful Specify → Design → Breakdown phases in one
invocation, enter Human, and stop for approval or refinement. After approval,
Apply advances one ready Task at a time and Verify closes or bounces.

For an Epic, continue Frame → Architecture → Roadmap in one invocation, enter
Approval, and stop for Epic-only approval. After approval, Delivery selects one
ready Story at a time. Each Story runs through the Story lifecycle and its own
approval; Epic approval never substitutes for it. Validation closes or bounces
the Epic without repairing implementation.

Persist and re-read the item after every Callee return. Do not ask the operator
to confirm routine phase transitions. Ask only for genuinely missing product
input or an approval/refinement decision.

## Output boundary

Normal host output — target resolution, route selection, phase progress, status,
errors, blockers, batch ledger rows, and normal Story or Epic phase results —
MUST NOT emit a standalone ### Acceptance criteria heading, including a
bullet-wrapped form such as `- ### Acceptance criteria`, or an unsolicited
user-facing approval-format acceptance block.

The lifecycle-generated exception is the informed approval request for the
current item. It MUST present the complete current-item acceptance first. This
boundary applies only to user-facing Markdown output and does not prohibit
internal or machine-readable acceptance artifacts such as requirements
documents, the Beads acceptance field, or `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA:` sections in a
normal phase result. An explicit operator request for acceptance criteria is
also allowed. No other phase, status, error, route, or batch output may print
that user-facing section.

## Approval contracts

Story Human request, in exact order:

1. ### Acceptance criteria — complete, current Story only, untruncated.
2. ### Design summary.
3. ### Task summary.
4. ### Approval request.

Epic Approval request, in exact order:

1. ### Acceptance criteria — complete, current Epic only, untruncated.
2. ### Architecture summary.
3. ### Story roadmap.
4. ### Approval request explaining that child Stories still need their own
   implementation approvals.

Only an exact Callee Human approval result persists human:approved for the
same item. Refinement clears approval and returns Story to Design or Epic to
Architecture. Ambiguous, conditional, inquisitive, denied, or failed results
withhold approval at the current gate.

## Epic delivery and batch rules

Epic Delivery reads Beads readiness, selects one direct Story by priority,
creation time, then ID, and invokes that Story through a Story route envelope.
It stops at a child gate, blocker, invalid state, or failed checks. It never
creates direct Tasks, invokes children concurrently, or transfers approval.

Explicit all-open-Epic mode takes one invocation-start snapshot of open Beads
Epics labeled prism, sorted by priority, creation time, then ID. Maintain an
exactly-once ledger and one outcome row per snapshot ID, including an empty
snapshot. Continue after item-local gates, blockers, or failures. Do not rescan
newly opened Epics and do not transfer approval between items. Abort only when
the initial snapshot cannot be produced safely.

## Apply and Verify

Before each Story Task, claim exactly one ready child as
prism/apply/implementer, run the project-native checks, then assign
prism/apply/reviewer and inspect the actual diff independently. Close only
after checks and review pass. Repeat until no open child remains.

When all Story Tasks close, use phase:story:verify with human:approved. Verify
is close-or-bounce and never an implementation repair loop. For an Epic, use
phase:epic:validation after all direct Stories close.

## Failure and recovery

Fail closed before child activity for unknown or malformed routes, missing or
ambiguous targets, invalid hierarchy, multiple supported phases, missing
acceptance, ambiguous approval, unsafe reconciliation, missing Router support,
or digest/resolved-tree mismatch. Preserve the current item and report the
phase and next action. Batch item-local failures do not terminate later
snapshot items.

Do not modify unrelated lifecycle surfaces, bump release versions, or push.
